# Playwright Test Suite

This test suite is built using Playwright with TypeScript, aimed at automating end-to-end (E2E) scenarios for a modern web application Automation Exercise (https://www.automationexercise.com/). The goal is to ensure that critical user flows like registration, login, session management, and logout work reliably under various conditions.

## ðŸ“¦ Setup

1. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Install Playwright browsers:

   ```bash
   npx playwright install
   ```

## ðŸš€ Running Tests

Run all tests:

```bash
npx playwright test
```

Run a specific test:

```bash
npx playwright test tc1-register-user.test.ts
```

View the HTML test report:

```bash
npx playwright show-report
```
